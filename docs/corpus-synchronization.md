# Corpus synchronization and provenance

RAHP corpora are curated adapters over source specifications. They are **not live mirrors**. A pressure-test result must remain reproducible against an immutable source snapshot even when the related repository continues to evolve.

The synchronization model therefore separates **portfolio discovery**, **source drift detection**, **semantic adaptation**, and **human approval**.

## What the portfolio monitor does

The DTG Portfolio Monitor repository registry is used as a **discovery and portfolio-scope control plane**. It tells RAHP which repositories are part of the monitored DTG landscape and supplies useful metadata such as workstream, lifecycle, role, reporting weight and material paths.

It does **not** decide which source a RAHP corpus must use. `corpora/sources.yaml` records that choice explicitly. This matters for forks: `CORPUS-DTG-ZKP` currently tracks `sankarshanmukhopadhyay/dtgwg-zkp-tf`, while mapping it to the portfolio entry `trustoverip/dtgwg-zkp-tf` as its upstream portfolio relationship.

## Multi-source external corpora

v0.7 removes a remaining DTG assumption from corpus validation. A corpus source must declare its primary repository and tracked paths, but `portfolio_repository` and `relationship_to_portfolio` are required only when the deployment actually uses a portfolio registry. External adapters may declare `additional_repositories` for composed or portfolio-wide scenario sources. The CAWG/C2PA corpus uses this form; normative repository drift is independently covered by the CAWG deployment profile monitor.

## Source of truth hierarchy

| Question | Authority |
|---|---|
| Which repositories are in monitored DTG scope? | DTG Portfolio Monitor `config/repositories.yaml` |
| Which repository/path does this RAHP corpus adapt? | `corpora/sources.yaml` |
| Which exact source state was semantically reviewed? | `corpus.source_commit` |
| What transformation/mapping revision was used? | `corpus.adapter_version` |
| What scenarios and `SP-*` mappings are authoritative in RAHP? | the individual `corpora/*.yaml` adapter |

## Status model

`tools/corpus_status.py` reports one of the following states:

- **UNPINNED_REVIEW_REQUIRED** — a legacy/archive snapshot has not yet been re-baselined to an immutable commit SHA.
- **UP_TO_DATE** — the pinned SHA equals the current tracked branch HEAD.
- **SOURCE_CHANGED_NO_CORPUS_IMPACT** — the repository advanced but configured corpus source paths did not change.
- **CORPUS_REVIEW_REQUIRED** — configured source material changed after the pinned commit.
- **PINNED_NOT_CHECKED** — offline validation confirmed an immutable pin but intentionally did not query GitHub.
- **DEPENDENCY_REVIEW_REQUIRED / RECOMPOSITION_NOT_TRIGGERED** — status for a composed corpus whose lifecycle depends on other corpora.
- **CHECK_FAILED** — GitHub or configuration status could not be evaluated.

## Why the current corpora remain `archive-snapshot`

The first synchronization release does **not** rewrite an existing `source_commit: archive-snapshot` to today's repository HEAD. Doing so would claim provenance that has not been established. Instead, the source registry records an observed bootstrap HEAD separately and treats each legacy corpus as requiring a one-time semantic re-baseline.

After a reviewer confirms that a corpus accurately represents a concrete source commit, replace `archive-snapshot` with that full 40-character SHA and change the provenance status accordingly.

## Scheduled status check

`.github/workflows/corpus-status.yml` runs daily and can also be launched manually. It:

1. loads `corpora/sources.yaml`;
2. obtains the current tracked HEAD using the GitHub API;
3. compares it with the corpus's immutable pin when one exists;
4. inspects changed filenames against the configured source paths;
5. writes Markdown and JSON status reports to the workflow summary/artifact.

The workflow is deliberately read-only. Detection is automatic; semantic modification is not.

## Preparing a review packet

Use the manual **Prepare corpus review packet** workflow, or locally:

```bash
python3 tools/corpus_review.py CORPUS-DTG-CREDSPEC --output build/corpus-review.md
```

The packet captures provenance, observed HEAD, relevant source changes, a reviewer checklist and an AI-agent handoff contract. It does not modify the corpus or advance its source pin.

## Human and AI responsibilities

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant GH as GitHub / source repo
  participant A as Automation
  participant AI as AI agent
  participant H as Human reviewer
  participant R as RAHP corpus

  GH->>A: repository advances
  A->>A: compare HEAD to source_commit
  A-->>H: relevant source drift detected
  H->>AI: prepare semantic change assessment
  AI->>GH: inspect changed source material
  AI-->>H: proposed scenario / mapping changes + citations
  H->>H: accept, amend, or reject interpretation
  H->>R: update adapter + reviewed immutable source_commit
  R->>A: validators and affected pressure tests
```

An AI agent may compare versions, classify changes, propose scenario edits, find moved anchors and run validators. It must not silently decide that changed normative text is semantically equivalent or advance `source_commit` without accountable review.

## Composed corpora

A composed corpus such as `CORPUS-TT-CREDSPEC-COMPOSED` tracks **corpus dependencies**, not a synthetic Git repository. Its `depends_on` block identifies the adapter versions and source baselines from which the cross-spec scenarios were composed. Re-baselining either dependency should trigger recomposition review.
