# RAHP glossary

RAHP terms in simple English. The structured YAML files under `method/glossary/terms/` are authoritative. This page is generated from them.

## Agent

A software or human actor that takes actions for itself or for another principal.

**Example:** A software agent requests a credential presentation on behalf of its user.

**See also:** `principal`, `mandate`, `delegation`

## Applicability

The conditions under which a risk, control, guardrail or test is relevant.

**Example:** A cross-context privacy guardrail applies only when correlation is not necessary for the declared purpose.

**See also:** `scope`, `guardrail-requirement`

## Assurance

Reasoned confidence, supported by evidence, that a system or control behaves as claimed.

**Example:** A replay test and its retained trace support confidence that duplicate execution is blocked.

**See also:** `assurance-pattern`, `evidence`

## Assurance level

A label for how strong the assurance evidence is, from basic inspection to stronger independent or automated evidence.

**Example:** A2 may require repeatable tests while A0 may only record that no assurance has been shown.

**See also:** `assurance`, `evidence`

## Assurance pattern

A reusable testable claim about a control or guardrail, including how to test it and what evidence to keep.

**Example:** Try a revoked delegation and confirm the action is blocked.

**See also:** `assurance`, `evidence-pattern`, `control-pattern`

## Audience

The party or set of parties for whom a message, credential, proof or authority grant is intended.

**Example:** A proof created for one verifier should not automatically be reused by another.

**See also:** `purpose`, `context-binding`

## Audit event

A recorded event that shows a control, guardrail, decision or override was evaluated or used.

**Example:** The log records that authority was checked and that an override was rejected.

**See also:** `evidence`, `auditability`

## Auditability

The ability to reconstruct what happened, which rules were used, who acted and what evidence supported the result.

**Example:** An investigator can trace a delegated action back to the principal and active mandate.

**See also:** `audit-event`, `evidence`, `provenance`

## Authentication

A process that establishes which actor, account, key or system is presenting itself.

**Example:** A signature verifies that a message came from a known key.

**See also:** `authority`, `authorization`

## Authority

The legitimate power to make a decision, request an action or change governed state.

**Example:** A valid signature proves who signed; it does not by itself prove that the signer had authority to approve payment.

**See also:** `authentication`, `authorization`, `delegation`

## Authorization

A decision about whether an actor is allowed to perform a particular action in a particular context.

**Example:** An authenticated agent may still be denied permission to transfer funds.

**See also:** `authentication`, `authority`, `scope`

## Composition boundary

The point where one specification, protocol or system relies on facts produced by another.

**Example:** A task engine accepts a credential status result from a separate credential system.

**See also:** `cross-spec-composition`, `enforcement-point`

## Consequential action

An action that can materially affect rights, money, access, safety, authority, privacy or an external system state.

**Example:** Revoking access, transferring money or publishing a credential are consequential actions.

**See also:** `decision-boundary`, `authority`

## Contestability

The ability to understand, challenge and seek correction or remedy for a consequential outcome.

**Example:** A person can see why access was denied and submit evidence for review.

**See also:** `redress`, `evidence`

## Context binding

A rule that ties evidence, authority or a credential to the task, transaction, audience or purpose where it is meant to be used.

**Example:** A witness credential names the trust task that produced it.

**See also:** `purpose`, `audience`

## Control

A deployment-specific measure used to reduce, detect, contain or recover from a risk.

**Example:** A verifier checks status immediately before approving a transaction.

**See also:** `control-pattern`, `guardrail`

## Control pattern

A reusable control objective that deployments can apply in their own way.

**Example:** Check current authority at the action boundary.

**See also:** `control`, `risk-pattern`, `assurance-pattern`

## Control side effect

A new risk or harm introduced or made worse by a control that was meant to reduce another risk.

**Example:** Extra identity checks reduce fraud but may increase exclusion or surveillance.

**See also:** `control`, `risk-pattern`

## Cross-spec composition

The combined behavior that appears when two or more specifications or protocols are used together.

**Example:** A credential can be valid under one specification but stale under the lifecycle rules of another.

**See also:** `composition-boundary`, `lifecycle`

## Decision boundary

The point where a system changes from gathering information to making or executing a consequential decision.

**Example:** The final approval step before an account is disabled is a decision boundary.

**See also:** `enforcement-point`, `consequential-action`

## Delegation

A grant of bounded authority from one actor to another.

**Example:** A person allows an agent to book one hotel within a price limit.

**See also:** `authority`, `scope`, `revocation`

## Enforcement point

The place in a system where a control or guardrail is actually checked and can stop, change or allow an action.

**Example:** A verifier checks current authorization just before it calls the payment API.

**See also:** `control`, `guardrail`, `decision-boundary`

## Evidence

Information kept to support or challenge an assurance claim, decision or finding.

**Example:** A signed authorization decision record shows what policy and authority were used.

**See also:** `evidence-pattern`, `audit-event`

## Evidence pattern

A reusable description of what evidence should be produced, who produces it, how fresh it must be and when it becomes invalid.

**Example:** A revocation propagation trace records when each enforcement point learned about a revocation.

**See also:** `evidence`, `assurance-pattern`

## Fail closed

To stop or refuse a consequential action when a required safety or assurance condition cannot be established.

**Example:** If current revocation status cannot be checked, the verifier defers the high-impact action.

**See also:** `fail-open`, `guardrail`

## Fail open

To continue an action even though a check or dependency failed. This must be explicit when it can create risk.

**Example:** A low-impact read may use a short cached value during a network outage.

**See also:** `fail-closed`, `risk-acceptance`

## Finding

A specific observation from a pressure test or security review that needs attention or a recorded disposition.

**Example:** The specification does not say how a user can challenge an adverse decision.

**See also:** `risk`, `recommendation`, `finding-disposition`

## Finding disposition

The recorded outcome for an earlier finding, such as unchanged, weakened, resolved or superseded.

**Example:** A new normative replay rule changes a replay finding from open to resolved.

**See also:** `finding`, `reassessment`

## Freshness

How recent information or evidence must be for a decision to rely on it.

**Example:** A high-impact action may require status checked within the last minute.

**See also:** `lifecycle`, `stale-state`

## Guardrail

A rule that blocks or stops an unacceptable state. It is stronger than normal guidance.

**Example:** Do not let a consequential action proceed when current authority cannot be established.

## Guardrail pattern

A reusable guardrail that describes what must not be allowed, where it is enforced and what happens on failure.

**Example:** Do not treat a valid credential as permission for an unrelated action.

**See also:** `guardrail`, `risk-pattern`, `assurance-pattern`

## Guardrail requirement

The catalogue decision that says whether a risk needs a guardrail, needs one only in some conditions, or is adequately handled by controls.

**Example:** A privacy risk may need a guardrail only when cross-context correlation is not necessary.

**See also:** `guardrail`, `applicability`

## Harm

A bad effect on a person, group, organization or public interest.

**Example:** A person is wrongly locked out of an essential service.

**See also:** `risk`, `harm-pattern`

## Harm pattern

## Override authority

The role or actor that is allowed to approve an override.

**Example:** Only the incident commander may approve an emergency continuity override.

**See also:** `override`, `authority`

## Principal

The person or organization whose authority, interests or instructions an agent or delegate is expected to serve.

**Example:** A traveller is the principal when a personal agent books on the traveller’s behalf.

## Prohibited state

A system state that a guardrail says must not be entered or continued.

**Example:** A payment proceeds even though required authority cannot be established.

## Protected interest

The person, group or institutional interest that a guardrail is meant to protect.

**Example:** Privacy is the protected interest behind a guardrail against unnecessary disclosure.

**See also:** `guardrail`, `harm`

## Provenance

Information about where an artefact, action, decision or claim came from and how it changed over time.

**Example:** A delegation trace shows which principal granted which delegate which scope.

## Residual risk

The risk that remains after controls and guardrails are applied.

**Example:** A cached status check lowers outage risk but still leaves a short stale-state window.

**See also:** `risk`, `risk-acceptance`

## Retest condition

A stated event that should cause an earlier assurance result or finding to be checked again.

**Example:** Retest when the specification changes its authorization model.
